My interests include everything that evolves, including living things such as humans, animals, plants and bacteria, as well as non-living things such as computers, servers, meals and cocktails. I continue to work on the diagnosis and treatment mechanisms of diseases. But if you have an idea about a different non-disease evolutionary mechanism, I'd be happy to listen and help.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.247","theme":"cosmo","title":"AHprojects","about":{"template":"trestles","image":"resources/img/ah.jpeg","links":[{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://github.com/ahprojects"},{"icon":"linkedin","text":"LinkedIn","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdullahhanta/"},{"icon":"researchgate","text":"Researchgate","href":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abdullah-Hanta"},{"icon":"orcid","text":"Orcid","href":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6158-5346"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
